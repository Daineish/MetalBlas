# MetalBlas
BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) for Apple's Metal framework, along with a test suite to benchmark against Apple's Accelerate framework.

This project is a work-in-progress. Currently supported functions in MetalBlas are:
    - metalSaxpy(), metalHaxpy()
    - metalSscal(), metalHscal()
    - metalSgemm(), metalHgemm()

Current implementations are functional and are not optimized.
